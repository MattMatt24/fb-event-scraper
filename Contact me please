# Hey just came across this script. it's the best thing i've come across and half solves a problem i have.

# Is there any way the script could just run through a set list of Facebook pages and grab the events, 
rather than keep scraping event hosts and going in an endless cycle?

# E.G https://www.facebook.com/rongevents/, https://www.facebook.com/EquinoxTrance/,https://www.facebook.com/puretrance/ .....
# and only scrape the events that these set hosts have?

regards
matt
